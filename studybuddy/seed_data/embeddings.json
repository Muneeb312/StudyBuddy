This information tells us how likely a word is to appear in a given context. For example, given the context \u201cMy favorite color is __\u201d , a language model should predict \u201cblue\u201d more often than \u201ccar\u201d . The Adventure of the Dancing Men (1905) \u201cThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\u201d, Sherlock Holmes. (1951) Claude Shannon used more sophisticated statistics to decipher enemies\u2019 messages during the Second World War: \u201cPrediction and Entropy of Printed English\u201d . Many concepts introduced in this paper, including entropy , are still used for language modeling today. Token The basic unit of a language model is token . A token can be a character, a word, or a part of a word (like -tion), depending on the model. -For non-English languages, a single Unicode character can sometimes be represented as multiple tokens. The process of breaking the original text into tokens is called tokenization . -For GPT-4, an average token is approximately 3\u20444 the length of a word. So, 100 tokens are approximately 75 words. -https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer Vocabulary The set of all tokens a model can work with is the model\u2019s vocabulary. You can use a small number of tokens to construct a large number of distinct words, similar to how you can use a few letters in the alphabet to construct many words.", "-The Mixtral 8x7B model has a vocabulary size of 32,000. -GPT-4\u2019s vocabulary size is 100,256. The tokenization method and vocabulary size are decided by model developers. Why token instead of word or character? 1.Tokens allow the model to break words into meaningful components. For example, \u201ccooking\u201d can be broken into \u201ccook\u201d and \u201cing\u201d, with both components carrying some meaning of the original word. 2.There are fewer unique tokens than unique words, this reduces the model\u2019s vocabulary size, making the model more efficient. 3.Tokens also help the model process unknown words. For instance, a made-up word like \u201cchatgpting\u201d could be split into \u201cchatgpt\u201d and \u201cing\u201d, helping the model understand its structure. Tokens balance having fewer units than words while retaining more meaning than individual characters. Language Models Types: Masked & Autoregressive Masked language model: Trained to predict missing tokens anywhere in a sequence, using the context from both before and after the missing tokens. -Commonly used for non-generative tasks such as: sentiment analysis, text classification, and code debugging. Autoregressive language model (Causal language models ): Trained to predict the next token in a sequence, using only the preceding tokens. -An autoregressive model can continually generate one token after another. -Commonly used for text generation -> much more popular. Generative AI The outputs of language models are open-ended . -A language model can use its fixed, finite vocabulary to construct infinite possible outputs . -A model that can generate open-ended outputs is called generative , hence the term generative AI. Completions are", "predictions , based on probabilities, and not guaranteed to be correct. -This probabilistic nature of language models makes them both so exciting and frustrating to use. Self-supervision Language modeling is just one of many ML algorithms . -Object detection, topic modeling, recommender systems, weather forecasting, stock price prediction, etc. Language models can be trained using self-supervision, while many other models require supervision. -Supervision refers to the process of training ML algorithms using labeled data: expensive and slow to obtain. -Self supervision allows create larger datasets for models to learn from, effectively allowing models to scale up. With supervision, you label examples to show the behaviors you want the model to learn, and then train the model on these examples. Once trained, the model can be applied to new data. The success of AI models in the 2010s lay in supervision. -The model that started the deep learning revolution, AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), was supervised. -It was trained to learn how to classify over 1 million images in the dataset ImageNet. -It classified each image into one of 1,000 categories such as \u201ccar\u201d, \u201cballoon\u201d, or \u201cmonkey\u201d. A drawback of supervision is that data labeling is expensive and time-consuming. -If it costs 5 cents for one person to label one image, it\u2019d cost $50,000 to label a million images for ImageNet. -However, not all labeling tasks are that simple. Generating Latin translations for an English-to-Latin model is more expensive. Self-supervision helps overcome the data labeling bottleneck. -In self-supervision, instead of requiring", "explicit labels, the model can infer labels from the input data. -Language modeling is self-supervised because each input sequence provides both the labels (tokens to be predicted) and the contexts the model can use to predict these labels. -For example, the sentence \u201cI love street food.\u201d gives six training samples. Self-supervision Large Language Models (LLMs) Self-supervised learning means that language models can learn from text sequences without requiring any labeling. -Because text sequences are everywhere (in books, blog posts, articles, and Reddit comments) it\u2019s possible to construct a massive amount of training data, allowing language models to scale up to become LLMs . Self-supervision differs from unsupervision. -In self-supervised learning, labels are inferred from the input data. -In unsupervised learning, you don\u2019t need labels at all. Parameter LLM, however, is hardly a scientific term. A model\u2019s size is typically measured by its number of parameters. A parameter is a variable within an ML model that is updated through the training process. In general the more parameters a model has, the greater its capacity to learn desired behaviors. -June 2018: OpenAI\u2019s first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) - 117 million parameters -February 2019: GPT-2 with 1.5 billion parameters, 117 million -> small. -Today*: A model with 100 billion parameters is considered large. Model weights to refer to all parameters. Why do larger models need more data? Larger models have more capacity to learn, and, therefore, would need more training data to maximize their performance. -You can train a large model on a", "small dataset too, but it\u2019d be a waste of compute. -Similar or better results on this dataset with smaller models. It seems counterintuitive that larger models require more training data. -If a model is more powerful, shouldn\u2019t it require fewer examples to learn from? -We\u2019re not trying to get a large model to match the performance of a small model using the same data. We\u2019re trying to maximize model performance .Foundation Models Foundation models mark a breakthrough from the traditional structure of AI research. For a long time, AI research was divided by data modalities. -Natural language processing (NLP) deals only with text. -Computer vision deals only with vision. -Text-only models can be used for tasks such as translation and spam detection. -Image-only models can be used for object detection and image classification. -Audioonly models can handle speech recognition (speech-to-text, or STT). A model that can work with more than one data modality is also called a multimodal model . A generative multimodal model is also called a large multimodal model (LMM) . Foundation models to refer to both large language models and large multimodal models .Foundation Models Foundation models also mark the transition from task-specific models to general purpose models. Foundation models, thanks to their scale and the way they are trained, are capable of a wide range of tasks. -An LLM can do both sentiment analysis and translation. Super-Natural Instructions is a benchmark to evaluate foundation models. Prompt Engineering, RAG, and Finetune There are multiple techniques you can", "use to get the model to generate what you want. Prompt Engineering : craft detailed instructions with examples of the desirable product descriptions. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) : using a database to supplement the instructions. Finetune : further train the model on a dataset of high-quality product descriptions. Prompt engineering, RAG, and finetuning are three very common AI engineering techniques that you can use to adapt a model to your needs. AI engineering AI engineering refers to the process of building applications on top of foundation models. People have been building AI applications for over a decade -A process often known as ML engineering or MLOps (short for ML operations). Why do we talk about AI engineering now? -If traditional ML engineering involves developing ML models, AI engineering leverages existing ones .How exposed different occupations are to AI A task is exposed if AI can reduce the time needed to complete this task by at least 50%. huyenchip.com/llama-police It\u2019s a lot of fun seeing what people are building with AI Open-source AI Tools - Coding \u25cfExtracting structured data from web pages and PDFs (AgentGPT) \u25cfConverting English to code (DB-GPT, SQL Chat, PandasAI) \u25cfGiven a design or a screenshot, generating code that will render into a website that looks like the given image (screenshot-to-code, draw-a-ui) \u25cfTranslating from one programming language or framework to another (GPTMigrate, AI Code Translator) \u25cfWriting documentation (Autodoc) \u25cfCreating tests (PentestGPT) \u25cfGenerating commit messages (AI Commits) Open-source AI Tools \u25cfImage and Video Production \u25cfWriting \u25cfEducation \u25cfConversational Bots \u25cfInformation", "Aggregation \u201cMy hypothesis is that we\u2019ll become so distrustful of content on the internet that we\u2019ll only read content generated by people or brands we trust.\u201d Models Evolution The limitations of many models are being addressed. Context lengths are getting longer. Model outputs are getting better. Model inference , the process of computing an output given an input, is getting faster and cheaper. AI engineering AI engineering evolved out of ML engineering. Three Layers of the AI Stack Application development : involves providing a model with good prompts and necessary context. This layer requires rigorous evaluation. Model development: This layer provides tooling for developing models, including frameworks for modeling, training, finetuning, and inference optimization. Because data is central to model development, this layer also contains dataset engineering. Infrastructure : includes tooling for model serving, managing data and compute, and monitoring. AI engineering vs. ML engineering 1. Without foundation models, you have to train your own models for your applications. With AI engineering, you use a model someone else has trained for you. This means that AI engineering focuses less on modeling and training, and more on model adaptation . 2. AI engineering works with models that are bigger, consume more compute resources , and incur higher latency than traditional ML engineering. This means that there\u2019s more pressure for efficient training and inference optimization. Many companies now need more GPUs and work with bigger compute clusters than they previously did. 3. AI engineering works with models that can produce open-ended outputs", ". Open Ended outputs give models the flexibility to be used for more tasks, but they are also harder to evaluate . This makes evaluation a much bigger problem in AI engineering. AI engineering differs from ML engineering in that it\u2019s less about model development and more about adapting and evaluating models .Model adaptation techniques Prompt engineering : adapt a model without updating the model weights. -You adapt a model by giving it instructions and context instead of changing the model itself. -Prompt engineering is easier to get started and requires less data. -However, prompt engineering might not be enough for complex tasks. Finetuning: requires updating model weights. -You adapt a model by making changes to the model itself. -More complicated and require more data, but they can improve your model\u2019s quality, latency, and cost significantly. -Many things aren\u2019t possible without changing model weights. Model Development Model development is the layer most commonly associated with traditional ML engineering. It has three main responsibilities: 1.modeling and training, 2.dataset engineering, 3.inference optimization. The process of coming up with a model architecture , training it, and finetuning it. -Examples of tools in this category are Google\u2019s TensorFlow, Hugging Face\u2019s Transformers, and Meta\u2019s PyTorch. Developing ML models requires specialized ML knowledge . -It requires knowing different types of ML algorithms (such as clustering, logistic regression, decision trees, and collaborative filtering) and neural network architectures (such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, and transformer). It also requires understanding how a model learns , including concepts such as", "gradient descent, loss function, regularization, etc. \u201cWith the availability of foundation models, ML knowledge is no longer a must-have for building AI applications.\u201d 1.Modeling and training 2. Dataset engineering Curating, generating, and annotating the data needed for training and adapting AI models. In traditional ML engineering , most use cases are close-ended -A model\u2019s output can only be among predefined values. -For example, spam classification with only two possible outputs, \u201cspam\u201d and \u201cnot spam\u201d, is close-ended. Foundation models , however, are open-ended -Annotating open-ended queries is much harder than annotating close-ended queries -It\u2019s easier to determine whether an email is spam than to write an essay. -So data annotation is a much bigger challenge for AI engineering. Models are now commodities: data will be the main differentiator Training a model from scratch generally requires more data than finetuning, which, in turn, requires more data than prompt engineering. 3. Inference optimization Making models faster and cheaper. One challenge with foundation models is that they are often autoregressive: -Tokens are generated sequentially. -If it takes 10 ms for a model to generate a token, it\u2019ll take a second to generate an output of 100 tokens, and even more for longer outputs. 100 ms latency expected for a typical internet application is a huge challenge. Inference optimization has become an active subfield in both industry and academia. Training, Pre-Training, Finetuning, and Post-Training Training always involves changing model weights, but not all changes to model weights constitute training. Pre-training refers to training a model", "from scratch: the model weights are randomly initialized. -For LLMs, pre-training often involves training a model for text completion. -Out of all training steps, pre-training is often the most resource intensive by a long shot. -Pre-training also takes a long time to do. Finetuning means continuing to train a previously trained model: the model weights are obtained from the previous training process. -Because the model already has certain knowledge from pre-training, finetuning typically requires fewer resources (e.g., data and compute) than pre-training. Post-training It\u2019s finetuning when it\u2019s done by application developers. Application development With traditional ML engineering, where teams build applications using their proprietary models, the model quality is a differentiation. With foundation models, where many teams use the same model, differentiation must be gained through the application development process. The application development layer consists of these responsibilities: evaluation, prompt engineering, and AI interface. Evaluation Evaluation is about mitigating risks and uncovering opportunities. Evaluation is needed to select models, to benchmark progress, to determine whether an application is ready for deployment. The challenges of evaluating foundation models chiefly arise from foundation models\u2019 open-ended nature and expanded capabilities. Prompt engineering Prompt engineering is about getting AI models to express the desirable behaviors from the input alone , without changing the model weights. Prompt engineering is not just about telling a model what to do. It\u2019s also about giving the model the necessary context and tools to do a given task. For complex tasks with long context, you might also need to", "provide the model with a memory management system so that the model can keep track of its history. Even with long context windows, LLMs don\u2019t reliably \u201cremember\u201d long histories and it\u2019s expensive to keep everything in the prompt. A memory management system decides what to keep, compress, retrieve, and forget across turns. LLMs are stateless per call. They don\u2019t persist history across requests. The only \u201cmemory\u201d they have is the current prompt (ephemeral) AI interface AI interface means creating an interface for end users to interact with your AI applications. -Copilot is commonly used as a plug-in in VSCode -Grammarly is commonly used as a browser extension for Google Docs. -Midjourney can either be used via its standalone web app or via its integration in Discord.", "Introduction to Python Programming Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Key Features: - Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier. - Dynamically Typed: You don't need to declare the type of a variable. - Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of complex applications. - Large Standard Library: Python comes with a vast library of modules and functions. Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, recursion occurs when a function calls itself. A recursive function must have a base case to stop the recursion.", "Data Structures in Python Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently.
